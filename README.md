My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

# [Forever Engine](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FunkinForever)
An open-source, quality of life and performance driven [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine!
----------------------------------------------

![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/916918345255751690/930068118938730526/legacy.png)

----------------------------------------------
The Friday Night Funkin' Forever Engine is an engine solely based on source code at the moment. Forever Engine is currently in legacy state as it is being rewritten. The legacy version of Forever Engine lacks accessibility and cohesion, something we are currently working to fix with the more newer and updated rewrite. Thank you for your patience.

**FOREVER ENGINE IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED ON DESKTOP! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CRASHES/PROBLEMS WITH HTML5, NOR AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING HTML5**

----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine FEATURES! - 
Noteskins,
Custom UIs,
Options Menu with FPS Capping and adjustments
A lot of modularity and freedom with options (hopefully in the future EVERYTHING will be toggleable)
A restructure and partial remake of the base game's source code
Source Code folder abstraction
More streamlined code (only having to set things in one place)
AND MORE!

I really wanted to make an FNF engine that was easier to work with than any other, mostly because I thought about how messy most other engines including the base game were. That doesn't mean Forever Engine is better than the base game however, Forever is only a tribute to Friday Night Funkin' and its modding community, a small project of mine that I hope people can find enjoyment and use out of!

----------------------------------------------

[Yoshubs](https://github.com/Yoshubs) - made the engine. she just so happens to be very fucking stupid for accidentally pushing the martian mixtape source code into forever engine's base github page

[Pixloen](https://github.com/PixlJacket) - made a lot of the custom assets that forever engine uses, he also gave me a lot of general advice on how to improve the engine as well as his input on both how to improve upon the base game and how the input system felt and such. ALSO PROGRAMMED SIMPLY JUDGEMENTS AND BACKGROUND DARKEN, He basically co-owns the engine lmao

[Gedehari](https://github.com/gedehari) - BANGER ASS PROGRAMMER, made the freeplay loading thread to avoid lag issues in freeplay, waveform render code (which will be used soon), freaking EXTERNAL SHADER SUPPORT for modcharts when they're a thing and so many other things like the crashlogger. I urge you to check out his project, [Izzy Engine](https://github.com/gedehari/IzzyEngine), which he let me borrow a lot of aspects from which I still owe him for lmao. AWESOME dude I can't stress this enough

[ImCodist](https://github.com/ImCodist) - helped with a couple of pull requests and issue fixes, ALSO MADE THE WHOLE ASS FREAKING DIALOGUE SYSTEM, but, I'm not gonna give him any credit at all, because he stole my obsidian soul in minecraft and I will never forgive him for that!!!!

[Scarlett](https://github.com/SomeKitten) - Overall cool friend of mine who knows a lot about programming and math that has helped me out countless times, still going here helping me with pushes, commits, etc. She wrote the finalised math formula for the note quants and fixed the song name issue.

How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with fnf, this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!
